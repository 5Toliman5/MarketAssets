Before running the application, it must be connected to a database via the DataAccess project and EntityFramework:
$env:PostgresConnectionString="Server=localhost;Port=5432;Database=MarketAssets;User Id=postgres;Password=postgres;"; dotnet ef database update;
this connection string must be equal to one written in appsettings.json.
After this the application can be deployed to a web server(e.g. IIS) or in DOCKER:
docker build -t marketassetsapi .
docker-compose up
Finally the application can be accessed by the default port if another is not specified: http://localhost:8080
Use the Postman collection.
